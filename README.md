## 🚀 Features

-   Data cleaning and handling of missing values.
-   Feature engineering (e.g., creating `FamilySize` and `IsAlone` variables).
-   Training and evaluation of three classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).
-   Model comparison using validation accuracy.
-   Final predictions for the test dataset.
